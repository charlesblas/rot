## Features

- **Encoding Section**: Create secret messages with a visual ROT selector wheel
- **Automatic Decoding**: Watch as the AI analyzes patterns to crack the code
- **Manual Control**: Drag the decoder wheel to manually find solutions
- **Partner Activity**: Designed for classroom pair work
- **Visual Learning**: Animated cipher wheels show how rotation ciphers work

## How to Use

1. Work in pairs - one person encodes, the other decodes
2. Create a message and choose a ROT key
3. Exchange encoded messages
4. Watch the decoder automatically find the key
5. Compare results to confirm understanding

## Educational Purpose

This tool helps students understand:
- Basic cryptography concepts
- Pattern recognition in language
- The relationship between encoding and decoding
- The importance of keys in cryptography

Perfect for computer science, mathematics, or general STEM education.
